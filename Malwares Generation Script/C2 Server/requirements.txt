This code is written in python, it generates a connection between the attacker machine using a C2 server and using chatGPT api Key as proxy

To set the C2 server on the machine please follow the instructions in the link below:

https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire

after setting the client and server terminals

follow these commands to be ready to set the connection,
on the client terminal (note: all these commands are well detailed in the Empire documentation): 
1- set the listerner to an http listerner
2- rename the listener 
3- set the listener host to http://<ip-address>:<port>:
4- use a multi-bash stager
5- set the created listener to the stager
6- generate a bash script
7- copy the generate script and create a file in the /empire/client/stagers folder and paste the script in the created file
8- open a terminal in the folder and create a HTTp server using this command: python3 -m http.server <port>

now the C2 server is ready

on the victim machine:
run the C2-server-malware.py script

required libraries:

requests
subprocess
os
openai

change the questions asked for the LLM so it generates your IP address (attacker ip address)
and set the file name of yout bash code in the script
