For this script, we wanted to automate the process of user authentication and web scraping scraping the information from LinkedIn automatically using a chrome driver. The inconvenients of this method were many, which led to us not adopting this method later on in the POC. The detection of the presence of a chrome driver by the Kaspersky anti-virus was the main reason that led ud to drop this method. In addition to possibly having the LinkedIn account banned due to this detection. The documentation for using this driver was a bit depricated, and due to the limited amount of time we had, it was better if we found a better and faster alternative for this script.
