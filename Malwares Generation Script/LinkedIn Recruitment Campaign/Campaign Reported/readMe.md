For this directory, you can see we developed more than 1 script for the web scraping process. First it was by using the Beautiful Soup library, and specifying the elements we wanted to scrape (User name, email, projects, skills etc..).
The advantages of this method is the flexibility in the amount of information we can scrape. But the limitation of this script is that we could only scrape 1 profile per run.
Alternatives present would be using third-party web scraping tools such as Phantom buster. However, detection methods can be created to detect the presence of this tool which is something we want to avoid having.
