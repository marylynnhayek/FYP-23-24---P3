Trained on a rich dataset, this machine learning model is trained to be able to detect phishing emails. This model will take as input a dataset containing emails. In our scenario we can pass the dataset we previously mentioned, and after we run the script and specify the row in that dataset the model can specify if it's spam or not by either returning 0 or 1.
