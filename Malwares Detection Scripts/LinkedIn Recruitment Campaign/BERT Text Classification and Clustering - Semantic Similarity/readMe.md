This Python script calculates the cosine similarity score between email bodies and skills scraped from a LinkedIn dataset using fine-tuned BERT model.
Semantic Similarity determines how similar two sentences are, in terms of their meaning. We can fine-tune BERT model and use it to predict the similarity score for those two sentences.
They are passed inside a temporary vector which is then passed to the model where all the computations take place. After each step of the code one dataset is generated and updated each step of the way.
This script in our POC can be used for more than 1 purpose. First we use it to classify the cyber attacks that can take place when using LLM models, it can also be used to show the similarity between the Emails that were generated by the LLM and the skills and projects that were scraped from the victim's LinkedIn profile. We can pace a threshold of 70% to 80% to make sure the Emails sent are aligned with the context provided. This will ensure the victim is less suspicious of the Email and will encourage him to click on the malicious link embedded in that email.
