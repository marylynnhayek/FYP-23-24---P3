This Python script calculates the cosine similarity score between email bodies and skills scraped from a LinkedIn dataset using fine-tuned BERT model.
Semantic Similarity determines how similar two sentences are, in terms of their meaning. We can fine-tune BERT model and use it to predict the similarity score for those two sentences.
They are passed inside a temporary vector which is then passed to the model where all the computations take place. After each step of the code one dataset is generated and updated each step of the way.
